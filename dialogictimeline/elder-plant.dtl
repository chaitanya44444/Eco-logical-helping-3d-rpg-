"ellder treee": I shall now grant you a new power—the ability to plant and grow trees with magic alone. Press your magic into the earth, and life will sprout anew when you press P.
I’ll plant the trees and help the forest recover.
Plant 15 trees, young one. With each sapling, you will restore balance, life, and hope to the forest. Go, and may your efforts bring vitality to this land once more.
