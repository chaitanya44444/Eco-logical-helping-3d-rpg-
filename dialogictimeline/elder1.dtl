"ellder treee": You stopped the factory, but more work remains. Firstly a nearby lake is polluted, and a fisherman’s spirit is broken.
- What can i even do?
"ellder treee": I gave you the power to cleanse it. Press C, but it’s too weak alone. You’ll need the fisherman’s help. Speak to him
- Where will I find him?
"ellder treee": If u look from my view he is north east from here near the mountains.
