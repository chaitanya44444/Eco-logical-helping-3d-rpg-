fisher: What do you want? The lake’s dead, and so is my purpose. I’ve nothing to offer.
- I’m here to help. The Elder Tree gave me the power to cleanse the lake, but I can’t do it alone. I need your bond with the lake to strengthen the magic.
	fisher: My bond? I’ve loved this lake since I was a boy, but now... it’s nothing but poison. What if it can’t be saved?
	- It can. But only if you believe and join me. Your connection to the lake is the key.
fisher: ...Alright. If you truly believe this can work, I’ll help. For the lake, and for what it meant to me.
